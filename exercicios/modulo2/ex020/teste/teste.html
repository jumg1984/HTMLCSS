        <h3>It must have been love

        <p>     
        It must have been
        love but it's over now...
        Lay a whisper on my pillow
        Leave the winter on the ground
        I wake up lonely, <span>there's air of silence</span>
        In the bedroom and all around
        Touch me now, I close my eyes
        And dream away
                    
        It must have been love but it's over now
        It must have been good but <span>I lost it somehow</span>
        It must have been love but it's over now
        From the moment we touched 'till the time had run out
        </p>

<h3>listen to your heart
        <p>Escute seu coração</p>
</h3>
<pre>
        <p>
        I know there's something in the wake of your smile
        I get <span>a notion from the look in your eyes</span>, yeah
        You've built a love but that love falls apart
        Your little piece of heaven turns too dark
                
        Listen to your heart when he's calling for you
        Listen to your heart, there's nothing else you can do
        I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
        But listen to your heart<span> before you tell him goodbye</span>
        </p>

        <h3>Take on me
                <p>Aceite-me!</p>
        </h3>
<pre>
        <p>
        We're talking away
        I don't know what
        I'm to say I'll say it anyway
        Today's another day to find you
        Shying away
        <span>I'll be coming for your love, ok?</span>
            
        Take on me
        Take me on
        I'll be gone
        In a day or two
            
        <span>So needless to say</span>
        I'm odds and ends
        But I'll be stumbling away
        Slowly learning that life is ok
        Say after me
        It's no better to be safe than sorry
        </p>

    <h3>Stay on these roads

<pre>
        <p>
        The cold has a voice
        It talks to me
            
        Still-born by choice
  <span>And it airs no need to hold</span>
        Old man feels the cold
        Oh, baby, don't
            
        'Cause I've been told:
        Stay on these roads
        We shall meet
        I know
            
        Stay on, my love
        We shall meet, I know
        I know     
        </p>
